- Use the Tec-1 to calcaulate sleep apnea score
- try with Arduino first

### Arduino code
- a simple DSP (Digital Signal Processing) filter to distinguish between snoring and non-snoring sounds 
- a basic frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is commonly used for this purpose.
- use the ArduinoFFT library, which provides an efficient FFT implementation for Arduino.

elements:
1. **FFT Library**: We're using the ArduinoFFT library to perform frequency analysis.
2. **Sampling**: We collect 128 samples at a 1kHz sampling rate. These parameters can be adjusted based on your specific needs and the capabilities of your Arduino.
3. **Frequency Analysis**: The FFT is computed on the collected samples, and we find the dominant frequency using the `MajorPeak` function.
4. **Snoring Detection**: We check if the dominant frequency falls within a specified range (60-300 Hz in this example) that is typical for snoring sounds. You may need to adjust this range based on actual measurements and research.
5. **Event Classification**: If snoring is detected, we then use the amplitude (represented by the DC component of the FFT) to classify the event as apnea, hypopnea, or RERA.

To use this code:
1. Install the ArduinoFFT library in your Arduino IDE (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries, then search for "ArduinoFFT" and install it).
2. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
3. Ensure your connections are correct:
   - Sound sensor to A0
   - Buzzer to pin 9

4. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 115200 baud) to see the output.

Remember to calibrate the frequency range and amplitude thresholds based on your specific sensor and real-world testing. This implementation provides a basic framework, but for a truly accurate sleep apnea monitor, you would need:

1. More sophisticated signal processing techniques
2. Machine learning algorithms for better classification
3. Clinical validation of the results

### mint code

1. Removed FFT: The code no longer attempts to perform FFT. Instead, it relies on the external band pass filter and detector circuit you mentioned.
2. Snoring detection: The `R` function reads bit 0 of port 0x12 to detect if snoring is occurring (i.e., if the frequency is in the 60-300 Hz range).
3. Sound level: The `L` function reads the full value from port 0x12 to get the sound level.
4. Event detection: The `C` function checks for snoring and then determines the type of event based on the sound level.
5. AHI calculation: The `I` function calculates the Apnea-Hypopnea Index as before.
6. Main loop: The `M` function continuously monitors for events, updating counters and sleep time.
7. Alarm: Uses port 0x13 to trigger the alarm when the event threshold is reached.
8. Output: Prints event counts, total sleep time, and AHI when the alarm is triggered.

To use this program on the TEC-1:

1. Ensure the band pass filter and detector circuit is connected to port 0x12 (bit 0 for snoring detection, full port for sound level).
2. Connect the alarm (buzzer) to port 0x13.
3. Enter the MINT code into the TEC-1.
4. Run the program by executing `Z`.
5. The program will continuously monitor for sleep apnea events.
6. When the number of events reaches the threshold, it will trigger the alarm and display the counts, total sleep time, and AHI.
