- Use the Tec-1 to calcaulate sleep apnea score
- try with Arduino first

### Arduino code
- a simple DSP (Digital Signal Processing) filter to distinguish between snoring and non-snoring sounds 
- a basic frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is commonly used for this purpose.
- use the ArduinoFFT library, which provides an efficient FFT implementation for Arduino.

elements:
1. **FFT Library**: We're using the ArduinoFFT library to perform frequency analysis.
2. **Sampling**: We collect 128 samples at a 1kHz sampling rate. These parameters can be adjusted based on your specific needs and the capabilities of your Arduino.
3. **Frequency Analysis**: The FFT is computed on the collected samples, and we find the dominant frequency using the `MajorPeak` function.
4. **Snoring Detection**: We check if the dominant frequency falls within a specified range (60-300 Hz in this example) that is typical for snoring sounds. You may need to adjust this range based on actual measurements and research.
5. **Event Classification**: If snoring is detected, we then use the amplitude (represented by the DC component of the FFT) to classify the event as apnea, hypopnea, or RERA.

To use this code:
1. Install the ArduinoFFT library in your Arduino IDE (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries, then search for "ArduinoFFT" and install it).
2. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
3. Ensure your connections are correct:
   - Sound sensor to A0
   - Buzzer to pin 9

4. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 115200 baud) to see the output.

Remember to calibrate the frequency range and amplitude thresholds based on your specific sensor and real-world testing. This implementation provides a basic framework, but for a truly accurate sleep apnea monitor, you would need:

1. More sophisticated signal processing techniques
2. Machine learning algorithms for better classification
3. Clinical validation of the results
