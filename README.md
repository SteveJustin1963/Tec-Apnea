- Use the Tec-1 to calcaulate sleep apnea score
- try with Arduino first

### Arduino code
- a simple DSP (Digital Signal Processing) filter to distinguish between snoring and non-snoring sounds 
- a basic frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is commonly used for this purpose.
- use the ArduinoFFT library, which provides an efficient FFT implementation for Arduino.

elements:
1. **FFT Library**: We're using the ArduinoFFT library to perform frequency analysis.
2. **Sampling**: We collect 128 samples at a 1kHz sampling rate. These parameters can be adjusted based on your specific needs and the capabilities of your Arduino.
3. **Frequency Analysis**: The FFT is computed on the collected samples, and we find the dominant frequency using the `MajorPeak` function.
4. **Snoring Detection**: We check if the dominant frequency falls within a specified range (60-300 Hz in this example) that is typical for snoring sounds. You may need to adjust this range based on actual measurements and research.
5. **Event Classification**: If snoring is detected, we then use the amplitude (represented by the DC component of the FFT) to classify the event as apnea, hypopnea, or RERA.

To use this code:
1. Install the ArduinoFFT library in your Arduino IDE (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries, then search for "ArduinoFFT" and install it).
2. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
3. Ensure your connections are correct:
   - Sound sensor to A0
   - Buzzer to pin 9

4. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 115200 baud) to see the output.

Remember to calibrate the frequency range and amplitude thresholds based on your specific sensor and real-world testing. This implementation provides a basic framework, but for a truly accurate sleep apnea monitor, you would need:

1. More sophisticated signal processing techniques
2. Machine learning algorithms for better classification
3. Clinical validation of the results

### mint code

Let me analyze this MINT code for a Sleep Apnea Monitor:

1. Purpose:
- Monitors breathing patterns during sleep
- Detects and counts three types of sleep events:
  * Apnea (severe breathing reduction)
  * Hypopnea (partial breathing reduction)
  * RERA (Respiratory Effort Related Arousal)
- Calculates AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index)
- Triggers an alarm if too many events occur

2. Key Constants:
```mint
50 a! // Apnea threshold
30 y! // Hypopnea threshold
60 r! // RERA threshold
10 m! // Maximum events before alarm
```

3. Hardware Interface Functions:
```mint
:R #12 /I 1 & ;   // Reads snoring detector from port 0x12
:L #12 /I ;       // Reads sound level from port 0x12
:A #13 /O ;       // Controls alarm on port 0x13
```

4. Event Detection (:C function):
- Monitors breathing sounds (60-300 Hz range)
- Classifies events based on sound level thresholds:
  * Below 50: Apnea
  * Below 30: Hypopnea
  * Above 60: RERA
- Increments appropriate counters for each event

5. AHI Calculation (:I function):
- Calculates Apnea-Hypopnea Index
- Formula: (apnea + hypopnea) * 3600 / total_sleep_time
- Provides severity metric for sleep apnea

6. Main Monitoring Loop (:M function):
- Continuously checks for events
- Tracks total sleep time
- Triggers alarm if total events exceed threshold
- Displays final statistics:
  * Count of each event type
  * Total sleep time
  * AHI score

7. Program Control:
- Starts with :Z function
- Runs until key press or alarm condition
- Provides user feedback through terminal

8. Features:
- Real-time monitoring
- Multiple event type detection
- Automatic alarm triggering
- Statistical reporting
- Time-based analysis

This code appears to be designed for the TEC-1 computer to function as a basic sleep apnea monitoring device, using sound level detection to identify breathing irregularities during sleep.
